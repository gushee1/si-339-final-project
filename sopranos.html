    <h2 id="main" class="blurb">Tony Soprano is a the head of the notorious Soprano crime family in 
        New Jersey, but this show focuses less on the day to day operations of the mob, and 
        more on the character of Tony himself. A surprising take at the time, but one that has been
        replicated countless times since, The Sopranos paints Tony as a flawed antihero, who viewers
        can't help but sympathize with, even after witnessing firsthand the awful things he does. 
        Over the course of 6 seasons, viewers see Tony fight through past trauma in therapy, deal with 
        the coming of age of his children, and handle the changing dynamics of his mob family.
