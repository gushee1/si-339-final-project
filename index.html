        In my sophomore year of high school, my chemistry teacher had a Breaking Bad poster on his classroom wall.
        He would always inject anecdotes from the show into our class, so I decided to watch it on his recommendation.
        I immediately was hooked, and finished the show within a few months. The whole time I watched it, I had heard
        of how heavily it draws inspiration from The Sopranos, but had never though of watching it.

            some references to the similarities between Tony and Walt.

        However, a few years
        later, during quarantine, my family decided to sit down and watch The Sopranos, as my parents believe it is a 
        necessary part of cultural literacy. Now, after watching both, I see many of the parallels that are talked about
        between the two shows, and can confidently say they are two of my favorite shows of all time.

        Many people have observed the commonalities between the two shows, and notably here is an article that describes
        <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/breaking-bad-has-a-secret-nod-to-the-sopranos-that-fans-missed.html/">
            one subtle nod to The Sopranos from Breaking Bad
